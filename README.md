# Re-assessing the phylogenetic status and evolutionary relationship of Forest Owlet [Athene blewitti (Hume 1873)] using genomic data
Scripts used for the UCE based phylogeny of Indian Owlets. 


HIGHLIGHTS

    Phylogenomics using genome-wide nuclear markers yielded a well-supported topology for Athene and Glaucidium lineages.

    Three different methods of phylogenetic tree construction showed that Forest Owlet is an early split from all other Athene species.

    Divergence dating in the bayesian framework puts the Forest Owlet age between 5.0my to 5.5my.
