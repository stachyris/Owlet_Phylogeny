# Owlet_Phylogeny
Scripts used for the UCE based phylogeny of Indian Owlets. All three species-Forest Owlet, Spotted Owlet & Jungle Owlet- whole genome data were generated using Illumina Short-read technology, denovo-assembled and subjected to UCE harvesting using standard Phyluce pipeline. All three methods--Maximum Likelihood, Bayesian Inference & Multispecies Coalscence- recovered identical topology and evolutionary relationship for Athene and Glaucidium with full (1/100) node supports. Divergence dating in bayesian framework using Approximation of Likelihood by MCMCtree, implemented in PAML estimated that Forest Owlet is an early split from among the Athene lineage and diverged about 5.1mya.
